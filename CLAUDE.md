# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES — READ THIS FIRST — NO EXCEPTIONS

These rules have caused the most wasted time and bad bugs. Read every one before touching a single file.

**1. NO GUESSING — EVER.**
Before writing any code, read the actual current file from GitHub raw. Before using any Supabase column, component prop, or API shape, verify it exists. Never work from memory of what a file "probably" looks like. Never assume a column name, prop name, or API response shape. Read it first, every time. Violations of this rule are the #1 source of bugs in this project.

**2. MOBILE RESPONSIVE ON EVERY NEW BUILD — NO EXCEPTIONS.**
Every new component, view, list, detail panel, form, and card must be built responsive at the same time it is built for desktop. No separate mobile pass later. No "I'll do mobile next session." Build it once, build it right. See Mobile Rules section below for patterns.

**3. DUAL NAV — ALWAYS BOTH FILES.**
Any change to navigation, topbar, or sidebar must be applied to BOTH `AppShell.jsx` (routed pages) AND `SedonaCRM.jsx` (SPA). Missing one = broken nav on half the app.

**4. ONE COMMIT PER SESSION.**
Stage ALL changes including CLAUDE.md in ONE commit. NEVER commit CLAUDE.md separately. One commit → one push → one deployment. No mid-session commits.

**5. PREVIEW BRANCH ONLY.**
All code goes to `preview`. Never push to `main` unless Scott explicitly says "approved, merge to main."

**6. npm run build BEFORE EVERY PUSH.**
Zero errors required. Fix all errors before pushing. Never push broken code — it deploys broken to Vercel.

**7. DESTRUCTIVE DB OPS — STOP AND CONFIRM.**
Before TRUNCATE, DROP TABLE, DROP COLUMN, DELETE FROM, or any ALTER that removes data: stop, tell Scott exactly what you're about to run and why, wait for explicit confirmation. No exceptions even with --dangerously-skip-permissions active.

**8. CC PROMPTS WITH JSX/TEMPLATE LITERALS → .txt FILE.**
Any CC prompt containing JSX or JavaScript template literals (backticks) must be delivered as a downloadable .txt file, not inline markdown. Backticks break markdown code fences and produce unpasteable output.

**9. CC OUTPUT DEGRADATION → CLOSE SESSION IMMEDIATELY.**
If CC output shows garbled text, truncated words, or sentences stopping mid-thought: flag it as "⚠️ CC output is degrading" and close the CC session immediately. Do not continue past this point.

## Project

SedonaCRM — custom AI-powered commercial property management platform replacing Podio + Globimail.
Owner: Scott Anderson, CCIM — Anderson Commercial Properties, Sedona AZ
Portfolio: 14 active NNN commercial properties, each a separate LLC (48 prop_codes total)
GitHub: https://github.com/ACPguy/sedonacrm-dashboard
Production domain: crm.andersoncp.com

## Working Directory

ALWAYS use `~/sedonacrm-dashboard/`. This is the active repo.
Chromebook: all files land in `/home/scott/` (Linux files root) — NEVER `~/Downloads/`.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev   # dev server at localhost:3000
npm run build
npm run start

# Daily workflow
cd ~/sedonacrm-dashboard
git add .
git commit -m "description"
git push
```

## Tech Stack

- Next.js + React, hosted on Vercel Pro ($20/mo)
- Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS)
- Tailwind CSS
- Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive (MCP connected)
- Twilio for SMS (Phase 6)
- Dropbox Sign (two-part sequential signing) for e-signature — Phase 5 Stage 3, ~$75/mo, for lease + lease amendment signing. Not yet built.
- Claude API — `claude-sonnet-5` for AI agents (Phase 4+). **Model strings need periodic review against Anthropic's deprecation schedule** (docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview). `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` was hardcoded in loi-draft.js and retired June 15, 2026 — caught and fixed 2026-07-11.

## Supabase

- URL: `https://edxcvyleielzevpappui.supabase.co`
- Anon key: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImVkeGN2eWxlaWVsemV2cGFwcHVpIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NzcxNjU3MjMsImV4cCI6MjA5Mjc0MTcyM30.OYSzunKtdw88PkhMyI9GSIa8MyIZ2paTgZ-Mg_oS4Yw`
- DB connection: `postgresql://postgres.edxcvyleielzevpappui:SedonaCRM2026@aws-1-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres`
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Anon SELECT grants exist on: `properties`, `tenants`, `rent_schedule`, `work_orders`, `issues`, `leasing_pipeline`, `property_insurance`, `tnt_cois`, `monthly_reports`, `property_taxes`, `suites`, `tasks`, `task_contacts`, `email_threads`, `email_messages`, `email_thread_links`, `communication_timeline`, `users`, `briefings`, `lease_watch_drafts`, `inquiry_drafts`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set in `.env.local` and in Vercel environment variables

## Core Architecture — Property as Hub

The Property detail record is the central UI of the entire system. Every related entity tab is a **reusable component** that accepts an optional `prop_code` filter:
- Inside Property detail → receives `prop_code` → shows records for that property only
- In standalone portfolio view → no filter → shows all records, sortable

**Property detail tab groups:**
1. Overview — core fields, map, key dates
2. Leasing — Suites, Tenants, Pipeline, Move-In, Move-Out, Rent Schedule
3. Financial — CAM, Taxes, PM Fees, Invoices, Insurance
4. Operations — Work Orders, Issues, Inspections, Key Safe
5. Ownership — Owners, Agreements, Monthly Reports, YR End Reports

Every tab uses **lazy loading** — data fetches only when tab is clicked, never on property open.

## Phase Status

- **Phases 0–3:** Complete
- **Phase 4:** Complete except Agent 9. All agents, BriefingView, EmailInbox, Drive folders, Home URL canonical route, cron auth — all done.
- **Phase 5:** IN PROGRESS
  - Stage 1 — DB Schema: Complete (2026-07-11)
  - Stage 2 — Pipeline API routes: Complete (2026-07-11)
  - Stage 4 (part 1) — PipelineView.jsx: Complete (2026-07-11); list+board view, dual nav, /pipeline route, mobile responsive, .crm-mobile-only CSS added
  - Stage 3 (Dropbox Sign) + Stage 4 parts 2–3 (detail panel, prop embed): Pending

## Agents Env Vars (Vercel) — all set ✅

- BRIEFING_SECRET, NEXT_PUBLIC_BRIEFING_SECRET, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- CRON_SECRET ✅ set in Vercel (Production + Preview) — confirmed working (Gmail watch renewal succeeded)

## Monthly Cost

- Vercel Pro: $20/mo | Claude API: ~$10–15/mo | Supabase: $0 | Total: ~$30–35/mo

## Known Gaps

- **CRITICAL — Podio migration status:** All current Supabase data is placeholder/test data only, imported via .xlsx exports. Podio remains the live system of record; staff continue working in Podio normally throughout the build. Two-stage sync plan: (1) parallel test sync — full Podio API pull of record data + inter-table links + comments + file attachments into a test environment, run alongside live Podio for several weeks to validate the new DB and find bugs; (2) final cutover sync — complete verified full sync, then Podio shutdown + CRM go-live. Never treat xlsx-imported data as final/production-ready. Never suggest the CRM is ready to cut over until the final Podio API sync is verified complete.
- **PENDING: S&G prop_code** — set up as a property (like ACP) with dedicated Drive folder; Scott will supply Drive folder ID for `drivePropertyFolders.js`
- **Inbox divider width persistence — NOT resolved, deprioritized.** Workaround: default width hardcoded to 570px. Pointer Events API fix (setPointerCapture) is live but persistence across hard refresh still unreliable in "release over address bar" scenario. If revisiting: re-instrument with console logging first — do NOT attempt blind fixes.
- **New Inquiry agent (Agent 3)** — uses LEASING_KEYWORDS filter. Manual **+LSG** button in EmailInbox for ambiguous cases (source='manual_lsg'). `LSG_PROPERTIES` array hardcoded in EmailInbox.jsx with 14 active properties (OLY/WNT excluded per Scott). lead-capture.js allows null prop_code. Future: Claude-API classifier if +LSG usage exceeds ~10/day.
- **leasing_pipeline working set** — 18 records (5 real + 13 'TEST — ' seeded) after 2026-07-11 reset. Delete all 'TEST — ' prefixed records before go-live. Stage filter: `stage=not.in.(Dead,On Hold,Landlord Declined Use)`; limit 5000.

## Next Priorities

1. Phase 5 Stage 4 (part 2): PipelineView click-through detail panel (record detail, stage transition buttons, LOI drafting UI, qual gate form)
2. Phase 5 Stage 4 (part 3): Pipeline embed in Property detail Leasing tab — replace inline tab with `<PipelineView propCode={data.prop_code} />` per TODO comment at SedonaCRM.jsx:888
3. Phase 5 Stage 3: Dropbox Sign integration (two-part sequential signing, webhook endpoint)
4. Extend LinkField to Vendor/Tenant join tables and future relationships (Key Safes, COIs, Vendor Services) once proper join tables exist
5. (Optional, low priority) Revisit inbox divider persistence — see Known Gaps for what's already been ruled out

## LinkField Architecture (permanent)

`components/shared/LinkField.jsx` — canonical many-to-many relationship field. Config-driven, zero hardcoded table names. Piloted on Task ↔ Contacts via `task_contacts`.

**Props:** `joinTable`, `parentIdField`, `parentId`, `linkedTable`, `linkedIdField`, `linkedFields` (select clause), `searchFields`, `titleField` (string or fn), `titleHref` (fn), `subtitleField` (fn/string, optional — phone/email line), `summaryField` (fn/string), `metaField` (fn/string), `readOnly`, `allowCreate`, `createFields`, `onCreate` (async fn → new row), `sectionLabel`, `variant` ('card' default | 'chip').

**variant='card' (default):** Podio-style stacked cards — UserCircle icon + title link (T.accent + ↗) + optional subtitle (phone/email) + meta line. No × on the card itself. Trigger button says "Add / remove"; opening the panel shows currently-linked items as removable chips at the top so unlinking is still possible. ContactsView "Linked Tasks" (readOnly, no subtitleField) renders as cards with just icon + title + meta, no subtitle gap.

**variant='chip':** compact inline pills with × unlink. Pass `variant="chip"` explicitly on any call site that wants the old look.

**Forward mode** (TaskDetail Contacts section): add/remove/search/create. Error displayed inline (not silently in console). `allowCreate=true` + `createFields` + `onCreate` enables inline create-and-link.

**Reverse/read-only mode** (ContactDetail Linked Tasks section): same join table queried from the other direction; no add/create UI; renders as cards.

**To add another relationship:** drop in `<LinkField .../>` with the correct props — no new state/effects/functions needed in the parent view.

**External link icon:** uses ↗ character inline (~11px), consistent with FieldWithBadge pattern. No circular badge.

## TaskDetail Architecture Notes (permanent)

- **Details tab — 7 section cards (in order):** Core → Follow-Up → Contacts (LinkField, all types) → Linked Companies (ContactFirstRow, always visible) → Work Order Details (WO only; Financials + Closeout collapsed sub-panels) → Notes & Relationships → Documents → Dates. System Info collapsible block at end.
- **Category:** shown in Core for all record types EXCEPT `work_order` (WO has its own WO Category field in the WO Details card).
- **Property field** in TaskDetail closed state: `CodeOnlySelect` component shows just prop_code; dropdown options show "code — name".
- **Linked Companies:** uses `ContactFirstRow` — user picks Contact → company auto-fills from `vendor_id`/`tenant_id` FK on the contact row → both saved atomically via `saveMany`. Company is read-only display. `FieldWithBadge` (module scope) provides the ↗ corner-badge pattern for FK fields.
- **`CompanyContactRow`** kept intact for NewTaskForm WO section (company-first flow).
- **Copy Link removed** from all 7 detail views (TasksView, IssuesView, WorkOrdersView, ContactsView, OwnersView, VendorsView, KeySafesView) — URL bar is sufficient.
- **Note record type** removed (zero rows ever existed).

## Schema Notes — leasing_pipeline FK gap (permanent)

`leasing_pipeline` has NO FK to `properties`. It links via `prop_code` (text) only. PostgREST join syntax `properties(...)` will NOT work from leasing_pipeline queries. Always query properties separately by prop_code when needed.

## Current Git State

- main: `9ce6031` — merged from preview 2026-07-11 (Scott-approved)
- preview: `b0159af` — LinkField card variant + subtitleField; Task Contacts updated

---

## Seeding Rules

Use `psql` only — `export DB='postgresql://postgres.edxcvyleielzevpappui:SedonaCRM2026@aws-1-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres'`
- Before seeding any table: check columns, drop CHECK+FK constraints, test R01, run full loop
- CASCADE check before any TRUNCATE: always run the referential check query against `information_schema` + `pg_constraint` first

---

## Workflow Rules

1. **All code to preview branch** — never directly to main unless Scott says "approved, merge"
2. **One commit per session** — stage ALL changes including CLAUDE.md in one commit. NEVER commit CLAUDE.md separately. One push = one deployment.
3. **npm run build before every push** — zero errors required
4. **Read CLAUDE.md first** — at start of every new session before doing anything
5. **Start fresh CC session after each major feature or ~2 hours** — keeps context lean, prevents slowdowns and output degradation
6. **CLAUDE.md size rule:** Keep under 30k chars. Remove oldest completed session logs before adding new ones.
7. **Push immediately after every commit** — never let commits sit locally. Every `git commit` must be followed immediately by `git push origin preview`. No batching commits before pushing.

## Session Close Procedure

1. Update CLAUDE.md: Next Priorities + Current Git State + any new permanent rules/schema. Keep under 30k.
2. Commit ALL changes + CLAUDE.md in ONE commit to preview branch.
3. Merge preview → main if Scott approved.
4. Upload build log to Drive (parentId: `1n6NTGVHDQJAYp14Z6LasI7uuwMV_pxUA`)
5. Upload updated CLAUDE.md to Drive as `CLAUDE_YYYY-MM-DD.md` (parentId: `1n6NTGVHDQJAYp14Z6LasI7uuwMV_pxUA`)
6. Move previous dated copy to Archive folder (`1I1kBuVZd7jbLh_WYzFtEBzrtmKcvazfb`)
- NEVER upload `.md` files without `disableConversionToGoogleType: true` + `contentMimeType: text/plain`
- NEVER upload to wrong folder

---

## Development Rules (permanent)

1. **SELECT DISTINCT before any UI field from Podio** — confirm exact values before building dropdowns/filters
2. **npm run build before every commit** — fix all errors first
3. **Left nav always-navigate on click** — use `handleNav`/`go` pattern: if already on target path, call `router.replace().then(() => router.reload())`
4. **Date fields always use `<input type="date">`** — browser native picker; display via `fmtDate()` (MM-DD-YYYY); store YYYY-MM-DD
5. **Pill hover:** inactive pills ~20% alpha active color on hover, `0.15s ease` transition; active pill: no hover change
6. **Multi-line text:** minRows=5, 120px min height, 72px bottom padding, full TipTap toolbar, auto-expand
7. **Destructive DB ops:** ALWAYS stop and confirm before TRUNCATE / DROP / DELETE / ALTER removing data
8. **List views default to Open only** — WO + Issues; fetch Closed only when user selects filter. Never filter a pre-loaded dataset client-side — each pill = new Supabase query.
9. **Mobile stat rows:** always `.stats-pill-row` + `.stat-pill` pill-style horizontal scroll on mobile (<768px). Never a multi-row grid on mobile.
10. **Filter state in URL query params** on every filter change; restore on mount via `hasMounted` ref
11. **Search queries: server-side LIMIT cap of 5 results per module** — never unbounded queries
12. **grep -n before editing any large JSX file** — CC frequently misidentifies line numbers without this step
13. **Claude.ai single instruction rule** — give one clear instruction at a time. Never counter an instruction with an alternative in the same response.
14. **AI agents draft only — Scott approves everything. Nothing sends autonomously, ever.** Applies to all agents (Lease Watch, CAM Reconciliation, New Inquiry, Work Order, Rent Collection, Insurance Cert, Morning Briefing, Owner Reporting, Re-Engagement, Portfolio Analyst).
15. **Every record requires:** unique URL, copy-link button, communication thread, audit log, AI summarize button, Drive file attachments. Audit log and AI summarize are not yet built on most record types — treat as an open build item per module, not as already satisfied.
16. **CLAUDE.md Current Git State must always reflect the ACTUAL commit hash of the last real code/feature commit AFTER it has been pushed — never a placeholder written before the commit exists, and never the hash of the CLAUDE.md-only housekeeping commit that follows it (since that commit's own hash isn't known until after it's made).** If uncertain, leave it for a small final follow-up commit once the real hash is confirmed via `git log -1`.
17. **Vercel Cron auth — CRON_SECRET is required.** All cron routes must check `req.headers['authorization'] === \`Bearer ${process.env.CRON_SECRET}\`` in addition to `x-vercel-cron`. Vercel's documented method is the Bearer token; `x-vercel-cron` alone is unreliable. Pattern: `isCron = x-vercel-cron === '1' || authorization === Bearer CRON_SECRET`. Plain GET (no cron header) returns existing data for UI polls. Never remove the Bearer check.

---

## Mobile Rules (permanent — applies to EVERY new component)

**The rule:** Every new component, view, list, detail panel, form, and card must be built mobile-responsive simultaneously with the desktop build. No separate mobile pass later. Build it once, build it right.

**Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: `max-width: 639px` (use `.mobile-hidden` to hide on mobile, `.md-hidden` to hide on desktop)
- Desktop: `min-width: 768px`
- Additional CSS classes: `.crm-desktop-only` (hidden at ≤639px), `.crm-mobile-only` (hidden at ≥640px — added 2026-07-11 for board view mobile/desktop split)

**Patterns by UI type:**

- **List tables on mobile:** use `.crm-mobile-cards` card pattern — hide table, show stacked cards
- **Tab bars:** `overflow-x: auto`, `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`, `scrollbar-width: none`, `.crm-detail-tab-bar::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none }`
- **Detail headers:** `flexWrap: wrap`, name uses `overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap`
- **Detail form grids:** `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(280px, 1fr))`
- **Stat summary rows above tables:** `.stats-pill-row` + `.stat-pill` horizontal scroll (see Rule 9)
- **ActivityPanel:** hidden on mobile (`.mobile-hidden`)
- **Touch targets:** minimum 44px height/width on all buttons and interactive elements
- **EmailInbox:** single-panel mode on mobile using `useWindowWidth` hook — list hides when thread open, show ← back button
- **Two-panel layouts:** stack vertically on mobile (flex-direction: column)

**Mental check before every commit:** "Does this work at 390px width?" If no — fix it before committing.

---

## Architecture Rules (permanent)

- **Single source of truth:** ONE shared component per table/list in `components/shared/`. NEVER build a second version for a sub-view or tab.
- **Dual nav architecture:** `AppShell.jsx` (routed pages) + `SedonaCRM.jsx` (SPA). ANY nav or topbar change must be applied to BOTH files.
- **`property_agreements` table:** ACP's mgmt agreement with property owners — NOT leasing pipeline. Never confuse.
- **Vercel build cache:** `next.config.js` uses `generateBuildId: async () => require('crypto').randomBytes(8).toString('hex')` — do not remove.
- **Vercel env vars:** changes require full redeploy. If a new var doesn't propagate after redeploy, delete it and recreate before redeploying.
- **GitHub raw reads:** subject to 60–120s CDN cache after push. Use `wc -l` comparison as fast check for whether a file changed.
- **Home URL:** `/home` is the canonical home route (renders SedonaCRM SPA). `/?view=morning-briefing` 307-redirects to `/home`. Do not revert to query-param routing for Home.

---

## URL Routing Rules (permanent)

- All detail pages use `podio_id`, NOT UUID: `/[module]/[podio_id]`
- Link generation: `record.podio_id ?? 'X'+record.id.slice(-6)`
- Vendors + Owners: ZERO podio_id coverage — all X-fallback until go-live Podio sync
- Tasks URL: bare `task_num` only (`/tasks/3685`) — never WO-prefixed
- Lookup: if param has hyphens → UUID fallback; otherwise → podio_id

## History API Rule (permanent)

ALWAYS spread existing state:
`window.history.replaceState({ ...window.history.state, url: newUrl, as: newUrl }, '', newUrl)`
NEVER use `replaceState({}, ...)` — strips Next.js `__N` marker, breaks Back button.

## Prev/Next Navigation (permanent)

All detail views support keyboard (ArrowLeft/Right) and button (‹ ›) navigation.
- List view writes `{module}NavList` + `{module}NavIndex` to sessionStorage on row click
- `goNav(dir)` fetches adjacent record, updates URL via replaceState (spread pattern above)
- `goNavRef` pattern required for arrow key useEffect with empty dep array
- Skip arrow key when in input/textarea/select or contentEditable

## Gmail / OAuth Rules (permanent)

- Token store: `email_accounts` table (not `gmail_tokens`)
- OAuth re-auth only at crm.andersoncp.com/settings (GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI is production only)
- Scopes: `gmail.modify`, `gmail.send`, `drive` — do NOT add `userinfo.email`
- Do NOT overwrite .env.local with `vercel env pull` — it strips Supabase keys
- Gmail watch expires every 7 days — auto-renewed by cron `0 11 */6 * *` via `/api/gmail/renew-watch`

---

## Tasks Module DB Notes (permanent)

- `tasks` table: record_types = work_order (2,914), task (1,234), sg_task (220), note/project/acp_task (0)
- UNIQUE index: (record_type, task_num) — task_num is Podio ID
- Display ID: `getTaskPrefix(task)` from `utils/taskPrefix.js` → `CR1-3685`
- Sequences: work_order=3717, task=1846, acp_task=518, sg_task=220
- Added columns: drive_folder_id, drive_folder_url, drive_index_pdf_id, vendor_contact_id, tenant_contact_id

## Schema Notes (permanent)

- `contacts`: added `vendor_id uuid FK → vendors` + `tenant_id uuid FK → tenants`
- `work_orders` + `tasks`: added `vendor_contact_id` + `tenant_contact_id`
- `briefings`: run_date (UNIQUE), status, urgent/attention/fyi/snapshot (jsonb)
- `lease_watch_drafts`: tenant_id + milestone (UNIQUE pair), subject, body, status
- `inquiry_drafts`: thread_id (UNIQUE), pipeline_id FK, prospect_name, prospect_email, subject, body, status
- `wo_agent_runs`: run_date (UNIQUE), status, nudge_items/high_cost_items (jsonb) — ✅ migration run 2026-07-09, table + RLS live
- `email_threads`: added `is_deleted boolean DEFAULT false` (2026-07-07) — set by batch-action delete action
- `email_threads`: added `last_sender_name text`, `last_sender_address text`, `has_attachment boolean DEFAULT false` (2026-07-07) — populated by webhook.js + sync-now.js on every new message; old threads show null/false until re-synced
- `email_messages`: added `has_attachment boolean DEFAULT false` (2026-07-07)
- **Phase 5 Stage 1 — 2026-07-11:** `leasing_pipeline` +30 cols (stage_5/7_state, pipeline_source, LOI negotiation fields, qual fields, broker fields, on_hold/dead fields). `suites` status CHECK +6th value `'Vacant / For Lease — Pending'`. `key_handovers` NEW table (employee/admin RLS only). `lease_applications` NEW table 106-col (employee/admin RLS only — contains SSN/financial data). `leasing_pipeline.stage` migrated from Podio values to 13-value model; original in `stage_raw_podio`; CHECK constraint added.
- **`task_contacts` RLS (confirmed 2026-07-16):** Anon key has SELECT (already listed above) + INSERT + DELETE. This is intentional — the CRM is an internal tool and LinkField uses the anon key client-side for link/unlink operations. If access scope ever needs tightening, add service-role API routes instead.

## Drive Folder Architecture (permanent)

- Trigger: auto-created on task save (fire-and-forget) for ALL record types; also manual `+ Drive Folder` button in WO header
- Structure: `[Property Root]/Work History/[YYYY-MM-DD] — [displayId] — [title]/`
- Hardcoded in `lib/drivePropertyFolders.js` (14 active properties; S&G folder ID pending)
- Index PDF upload silently failing (pdf-lib issue) — independent of folder creation

## Embedded TasksView Architecture (permanent)

All 5 embedded Tasks tab contexts use `<TasksView embeddedMode hidePropertyPills filterXxx={...}/>`:
| Context | Props |
|---|---|
| Property detail (SedonaCRM.jsx) | `filterPropCode={data.prop_code} hidePropertyPills embeddedMode` |
| Owner detail (OwnersView.jsx) | `filterPropCode={data.prop_code} hidePropertyPills embeddedMode` |
| Tenant detail (TenantsView.jsx) | `filterTenantId={data.id} hidePropertyPills embeddedMode` |
| Vendor detail (VendorsView.jsx) | `filterVendorId={data.id} hidePropertyPills embeddedMode` |
| Contact detail (ContactsView.jsx) | `filterContactId={data.id} hidePropertyPills embeddedMode` |
